# good-night-bot
Welcome tothe **good Night Bot** , a personal project that I have created to help me notify my family members of my sleeping arrangement. As someone who has two homes in different locations and a busy schedule, it can be challenging to keep track of where I am spending the night.

That's why I decided to create this Telegram bot that automatically calculates the probability of my sleeping house and sends a message to the other family if I am not spending the night with them. It has been a labor of love, and I am excited to share it with others who may find it useful.
